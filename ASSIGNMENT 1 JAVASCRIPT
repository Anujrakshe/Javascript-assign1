 Question 1 :
      Explore and explain the various methods in console function....

1.console.log()
function in JavaScript which is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it. 

<script> 
var a = 2; 
console.log(a); 
</script> 


2.Console.warn()
Outputs a warning message to the Web Console.

function compareNumber(x, y) { 
	
	if (x > y)
		console.warn({x} is greater then {y}); 
	}  


3.console.assert()
writes an error message to the console if the assertion is false.

<script> 
console.assert(document.getElementById("MyElement")
</script> 


4.console.clear()
 clears the console


5.console.debug()
outputs a message to the web console at the "debug" log level.

6.Console.table()
Displays tabular data as a table

// an array of strings

console.table(["apples", "oranges", "bananas"])


7.Console.time()
Starts a timer you can use to track how long an operation takes

8.Console.profile()
Starts recording a performance profile


                      Question 2 :
         Write the difference between var, let and const with code examples.

In Javascript variables are defined using the keywords var.let or const.
var a=10;
let b=20;
const PI=3.14;

A var variable can be redeclared and updated.
A let variable be be updated but not redeclared.
    EXAMPLE OF LET
// This 'let' is scoped to the window (globally):
let winner = false;
if(points > 40) {
// This 'let' is scoped to the block (between the curly brackets):
  let winner = true;
}

     EXAMPLE OF VAR
let points = 50;
var winner = false;
if(points > 40) {
  var winner = true;
}
// If I call:
winner
// It now returns: 
true


const variables cannot be updated. let variables are made to be updated.
const joseph = Object.freeze(person);




                     Question 3 :
       Write a brief intro on available data types in Javascript.

there are 7 data types in Javascript from which six data types are Primitive(predefined).
1.Numbers: 5, 6.5, 7 etc.
2.String: “Hello GeeksforGeeks” etc.
3.Boolean: Represent a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.
4.Null: This type has only one value : null.
5.Undefined: A variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined.
6.Object: It is the most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. We will learn about these data types in details in further articles.
7.Arrays: arrays are written with square brackets.Array items are separated by commas.

examples of each....

    numbers
var x1 = 34;   
var x2 = 38;

    strings
var carName1 = "Volvo XC60"

    Booleans
var x = 5;
var y = 5;
var z = 6;
(x == y) 
(x == z)


   Undefined
var car;

   Null
var person = {firstName:"Sai", lastName:"Kiran", age:30};
person = null;

    Objects
var person = {firstName:"Sai", lastName:"Kiran", age:30};

    Arrays
var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
